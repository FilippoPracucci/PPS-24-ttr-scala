railway routes characterized by colors. During a turn a player can draw 2 cards from the deck or claim a route.
A player in order to claim a route has to play cards of the color of the route.
Each player has 45 train cars, which are placed to claim routes and when a player remains with less than 3 train cars
starts the last round. At the end of the game the player with the most points wins.
